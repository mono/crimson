This assembly goal is to provide a managed wrapper on top of libcrypto[1].

libcrypto Availability
----------------------

Most Linux distributions ship with openssl. 

Building
--------

If a recent mono is available then 'make' should be enough to build
the generator (creating the source files) and then build the assembly

You can verify that everything works, if nunit is available, by doing
'make run-test'
