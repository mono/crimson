This assembly goal is to provide a managed wrapper on to /dev/crypto
also known as `cryptodev`.

CryptoDev Availability
----------------------

Most Linux distributions do not ship /dev/crypto so you'll have to:

1. build it yourself (from the above link);

2. install the driver, e.g.

	sudo insmod /path/to/cryptodev.ko

3. give read/write permissions to the device, e.g. for everyone do:

	sudo chmod 666 /dev/crypto


Building
--------

If a recent mono is available then 'make' should be enough to build
the generator (creating the source files) and then build the assembly

You can verify that everything works, if nunit is available, by doing
'make run-test'


mv_cesa specific notes
----------------------

Hardware have limited internal buffers to work on. The drivers should 
make this limit invisible to callers. This is not (always) the case.

Testing as show that the hardware limit is hit if we use more than:

1920 bytes for SHA1
1936 bytes for AES

As such the code can be adapted to work with those limits. By default
the implementations will use a limit of Int32.MaxValue but, if defined
differently, will iterate large buffers based on a smaller limit (and
workaround the driver limitation).

Changing this limit is done using environment variables, e.g.

CRIMSON_AES_BUFFER_BLOCK_SIZE=1936 make run-test

will run the unit tests using a block size limited to 1936 bytes.
While

CRIMSON_SHA1_BUFFER_BLOCK_SIZE=1920 make run-test

will run the unit tests with a block size limited to 1920 bytes.

This way each algorithm limitation can be configured separately. Even
if the limit is likely identical between many of them.

Since having those limits potentially requires a lot more native/kernels
calls, reducing overall performance, it should only be used if required.
