The following assemblies are available in Crimson:

* Crimson.CryptoDev.dll

	This assembly provides wrapper around the kernel cryptographic 
	algorithm implementations, either native or hardware accelerated.
	Ref: http://home.gna.org/cryptodev-linux/

* Crimson.MHash.dll

	This assembly provides wrapper around the native hash implementations 
	around libmhash (http://mhash.sourceforge.net/). It serve two main 
	purposes:

	* it provides native (and potentially faster) implementation of common
	hash algorithms (e.g. MD5, SHA1, SHA-256/384/512) already part of the
	.NET framework;

	* it provides implementation for many, less know (e.g. TIGER, SNEFRU)
	or non-cryptographic (e.g. CRC32), hash algorithms.


The Crimson module is open to new wrappers around existing cryptographic 
libraries as well as new crypto-related ideas.
